put()-->put an item into the queue 
get()-->remove and return an item from queue 


producer thread uses put() method to insert data in the queue .internally this method has logic to 
acquire the lock before inserting  data into queue.after inserting data lock will be released automatically 


put() method also checks whether the queue is full or not and if queue is full then the producer thread will entered into waiting
state by calling wait() method internally 



note:
.....
the queue module takes care of locking for us which is great advantage
